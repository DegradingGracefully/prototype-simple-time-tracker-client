This is just a temporary repo that I had to publish in order to share some code ;)

It contains __the client project__ of a working simple time tracker prototype programmed in Node, Express, Svelte and MongoDB.

The __server part__ is @ [https://github.com/DegradingGracefully/prototype-simple-time-tracker-server](https://github.com/DegradingGracefully/prototype-simple-time-tracker-server) .

And even though I plan to open source this app eventually, it currently doesn't have enough features (plus source code needs some refactoring and cleaning).

So, in a word, don't try to use it :p

Thanks Mark Volkmann which Todo List code I used to bootstrap this project
